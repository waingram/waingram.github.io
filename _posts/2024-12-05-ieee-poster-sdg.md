## **About the Study**

Accurately assessing research contributions to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a growing priority for academic institutions. Traditional methods, which rely heavily on keyword-based Boolean search queries, often conflate incidental keyword matches with genuine contributions to SDG targets, leading to reduced precision in bibliometric analyses.

Our study proposes a novel approach: leveraging **small, locally-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs)** as evaluation agents to address the limitations of keyword-based retrieval. Using a dataset of 340,000 abstracts retrieved via SDG-specific keyword queries, we demonstrated how these models can distinguish between semantically relevant contributions to SDG targets and incidental mentions.

## **Key Highlights**

- **Novel Application**: We evaluated three small, locally-hosted LLMs—**Mistral-7B**, **Phi-3.5-mini**, and **Llama-3.2**—for their ability to classify SDG-related research contributions with greater precision than traditional methods.
- **Improved Precision**: These models leverage their semantic understanding to move beyond surface-level keyword matching, addressing key limitations in traditional SDG classification workflows.
- **Scalability**: By running these LLMs locally, the approach offers a cost-efficient and scalable framework for institutions to align research with SDG goals.

## **Why It Matters**

This work represents a step forward in SDG-related research evaluation, providing a more nuanced and precise approach to classifying scholarly contributions. The findings have broader implications for institutional benchmarking, funding strategies, and semantic search applications.

## **Future Directions**

Our research paves the way for:
1. Developing **multi-agent frameworks** that combine multiple models to refine classification further.
2. Applying these techniques in **semantic search systems** to enable more effective discovery of SDG-relevant research.

## **Read the Full Preprint**

The full preprint of our work is available on **arXiv**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17598).

We look forward to presenting this work at **IEEE BigData 2024** and engaging with the community on the potential of LLMs in advancing SDG-related research.
