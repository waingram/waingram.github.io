  <h1>Research Program</h1>

  <h2>Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval for Scholarly Text Analysis</h2>
  <p> My research focuses on the intersection of <span itemprop="knowsAbout">Natural Language
      Processing (NLP)</span> and <span itemprop="knowsAbout">Information Retrieval (IR)</span> in the
    context of <span itemprop="knowsAbout">Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs)</span>. NLP
    provides methods for structuring, classifying, and summarizing textual data, while IR enables
    scalable indexing, retrieval, and ranking of relevant content. Together, these fields support
    computational approaches for identifying research contributions, improving metadata quality, and
    facilitating more effective access to ETD collections. </p>

  <h2>Computational Methods for Document Structure and Classification</h2>
  <p> From 2019 to 2023, an IMLS-funded project developed methods for automated document structure
    extraction and classification in <span itemprop="knowsAbout">ETDs</span>. This work applied <span
      itemprop="knowsAbout">NLP</span> models for: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Segmenting long-form academic texts into structured components, including chapters,
      sections, figures, and tables.</li>
    <li>Classifying text at multiple levels to improve metadata representation and retrieval.</li>
    <li>Generating chapter-level summaries to support efficient navigation of dissertation content.</li>
    <li>Developing a prototype digital library system that integrates these classification and
      summarization methods into ETD collections.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> These approaches addressed the challenges of working with unstructured academic texts,
    establishing methods for large-scale processing of <span itemprop="knowsAbout">ETDs</span> while
    maintaining their integrity as structured research objects. </p>

  <h2>Retrieval-Augmented NLP for SDG Classification and Synthesis</h2>
  <p> A subsequent IMLS-funded project (2024–2027) builds on these methods by integrating <span
      itemprop="knowsAbout">retrieval-augmented models</span> with a curated <span itemprop="knowsAbout">ETD
      corpus</span>. This project investigates: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for incorporating external knowledge from ETDs into
      language model outputs.</li>
    <li>Semantic representations of research contributions through transformer-based classifiers
      trained to recognize alignment with <span itemprop="knowsAbout">United Nations’ Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs)</span>.</li>
    <li><span itemprop="knowsAbout">Transfer learning</span> techniques for adapting classification
      models trained on journal literature to the distinct characteristics of ETDs.</li>
    <li>Hybrid retrieval models that integrate sparse (BM25) and dense (neural) retrieval for more
      precise identification of <span itemprop="knowsAbout">SDG-related</span> research.</li>
    <li>Text generation methods for synthesizing research narratives from retrieved ETD content,
      providing structured summaries of institutional research contributions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> This work applies <span itemprop="knowsAbout">IR</span> techniques to enhance <span
      itemprop="knowsAbout">NLP-driven classification</span> and text synthesis, addressing the
    limitations of keyword-based SDG identification by introducing <span itemprop="knowsAbout">semantic
      retrieval</span> and contextual classification models. The integration of retrieval-based
    ranking and language modeling supports research applications that extend beyond static metadata,
    allowing for more nuanced representations of academic work. </p>

  <h2>Artificial Intelligence for Scholarly Knowledge Systems</h2>
  <p> The methodological contributions of this research inform the development of computational
    models for scholarly information systems, with applications in document retrieval,
    classification, and synthesis. By combining retrieval-based ranking, transformer-based text
    classification, and generative summarization methods, this work develops computational
    approaches for structuring and analyzing large-scale <span itemprop="knowsAbout">ETD</span>
    collections. As <span itemprop="worksFor" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/EmployeeRole">
